Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. Explain the reason for your choice of parameters for the =drawTile= method.

2. Why is finding the median value difficult?  The simplest ways of doing it would
take a long time for large data sets; how could you do it efficiently?


Reflection:
=========================
For the drawTile method, I used x, y, width, and height so the tile position and size could be specified. I used a boolean value to indicate wheather the tile should be a straight line type or a curved line type. The two color variables combined with the rotate90 boolean allow you to specify any of the basic tiles with two lines on them. 

The median value was difficult to calculate because for the algorithm I am using, the values must be sorted to find the middle ones. I am using Collections.sort to sort the data, this method implements Merge Sort. Merge sort is not the fastest best case sorting algorithm. This sorting requires a relatively large amount of system resources so it would take a long time for large data sets. To do this more efficiently, a faster sorting algorithm such as Quick Sort could be used, or use a selection algorithm such as Quick Select to find the (k)th smallest value where k is the size of the array / 2. There are also other algorithms such as Median of Medians that finds an approximate median.
